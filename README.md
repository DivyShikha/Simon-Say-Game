# Simon-Say-Game
The "Simon Says" game is a memory-based challenge where players must repeat a sequence of colored buttons in the correct order. The game starts with a randomly chosen button, and with each successful round, the sequence gets longer. The player must correctly replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
